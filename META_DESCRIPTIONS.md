```
Stellar Focus is the companion extension for Stellar, an offline-first productivity app. During active focus sessions, it blocks websites you've configured as distractions—keeping you on task.

Key features:
• Blocks only during focus phases (breaks are free)
• Real-time sync with Stellar via WebSocket
• Day-of-week scheduling for block lists
• Multiple block lists with independent schedules
• Subdomain matching (blocks www. and subdomains)
• Beautiful blocked page with encouraging messages
• Offline-safe: never blocks when connection is uncertain

How it works:
1. Log in with your Stellar account
2. Start a focus session in the Stellar app
3. Navigate normally—blocked sites redirect to an encouraging page
4. Breaks and idle time allow full access

Privacy-focused:
• No browsing history collected
• Data stored locally and in your Supabase project
• Open source

## D) Chrome Web Store Description

**Note: Start with a concise statement of what the extension does.**

```
Stellar Focus blocks distracting websites during your Pomodoro-style focus sessions from the Stellar productivity app.

When you start a focus session in Stellar, the extension intercepts navigation to sites in your block lists and redirects you to an encouraging page. During breaks and idle time, all sites are accessible.

FEATURES

• Focus-phase blocking only
  Websites are blocked during focus phases. Breaks and pauses allow full access.

• Real-time synchronization
  Changes in Stellar appear instantly via WebSocket subscriptions.

• Day-of-week scheduling
  Configure block lists to activate only on specific days (weekdays, weekends, custom).

• Multiple block lists
  Create separate lists for social media, news, entertainment—each with its own schedule.

• Subdomain matching
  Block "youtube.com" to also block "www.youtube.com" and "music.youtube.com".

• Cinematic blocked page
  Get redirected to a beautiful space-themed page with an animated galaxy and rotating encouragement messages.

• Fail-safe offline behavior
  Never blocks when offline—ensures you're never locked out unexpectedly.
