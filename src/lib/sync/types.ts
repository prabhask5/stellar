/**
 * Intent-Based Sync Operation Types
 *
 * These types enable preserving operation intent (e.g., "increment by 1")
 * rather than just final state (e.g., "current_value: 50").
 *
 * Benefits:
 * - Rapid increments are coalesced (50 +1s → single +50)
 * - Proper conflict resolution in future phases:
 *   - Device A increments 50 times → intent preserved as +50
 *   - Device B increments 30 times → intent preserved as +30
 *   - Merge result: +80 (not overwrite with one device's value)
 */

/**
 * Operation types that preserve intent:
 * - 'increment': Add delta to numeric field (e.g., current_value += 1)
 * - 'set': Set field to value (works for any type)
 * - 'create': Create new entity
 * - 'delete': Soft delete entity

 * Intent-based sync operation item.

 * Key design:
 * - Uses `operationType` to specify the operation intent
 * - Has optional `field` for field-level operations
 * - `value` is the delta (for increment) or new value (for set/create)
 *
 * For create operations, value contains the full entity payload.
 * For increment operations, value contains the delta to add.
 * For set operations, value contains the new field value(s).
 * For delete operations, value is not used.
